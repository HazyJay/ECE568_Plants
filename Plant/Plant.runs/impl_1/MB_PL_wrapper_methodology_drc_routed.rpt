CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net sys_clock_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): sys_clock_IBUF_inst/O

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock MB_PL_i/clks/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin MB_PL_i/clks/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -hier -filter {NAME =~ */u_iodelay_ctrl/sys_rst}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '32' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
